                    Hi, my name is Michael Dairo and I am a Data Analyst/Scientist as well as a freelance web developer. I am a university graduate from the Federal University of Technology Akure.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    My passion for data and data analytics started off during my final year in the university. I was faced with a challenge of analysing my final year project data using statistical methodologies. Having had a brief stint in statistics during my coursework,
                    I studied assiduously, making use of vast online resources to conquer the challenge at hand. I have since gone ahead to further my studies in the field of Data Analysis/Science, Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics by taking online
                    courses.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I am currently working as an Accounts Officer(Sales Data Analyst) for Edi-Jen Group Nig Ltd while freelancing as a data Data Analyst.

                                This is a Sentiment Analysis problem and it was approached utilizing Natural Language Processing techniques to clean and structure the highly unclean and unstructured tweets text data into a proper form that can be fed into our algorithms. The cleaned
                                and structured dataset was modeled using different Machine Learning Classification Algorithms and predictions were made to successfully classify a tweet into one of the four (4) sentiment classes, namely; <em>positive, negative, neutral and factual</em>.
                                An accuracy of 75% was recorded from the best performing algorithm.

                                This is a text classification problem. As such, Natural Language Processing techniques were employed clean the data and engineer new features. Finally Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms were used to model and successfully classify a language text
                                into its appropriate language class with a 96% accuracy on datasets the algorithms had not yet seen.

                                on in order to maintain and improve the standard of living by investing in electricity infrastructure. However, in recent years, there has been evidence that the use of purely non-renewable sources is not sustainable. The
                                government of Spain is considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel
                                energy generation. For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.

                                where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options. With this context, construct a recommendation algorithm based on
                                content or collaborative filtering. Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being given personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity
                                for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.

                                There are two major types of recommender systems; Collaborative and Content Based recommender systems. To tackle this problem, a content based recommendation system was developed using different categories of meta data; Movie description, keywords, tags,
                                cast and crew etc.
