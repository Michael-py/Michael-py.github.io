                            <h3>The Problem</h3>

                            <p>In today's technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical to ensure that individuals can make optimised choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application
                                where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options. With this context, construct a recommendation algorithm based on
                                content or collaborative filtering. Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being given personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity
                                for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.

                            <h3>The Solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                There are two major types of recommender systems; Collaborative and Content Based recommender systems. To tackle this problem, a content based recommendation system was developed using different categories of meta data; Movie description, keywords, tags,
                                cast and crew etc.

                            <p>
                                This is a text classification problem. As such, Natural Language Processing techniques were employed clean the data and engineer new features. Finally Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms were used to model and successfully classify a language text
                                into its appropriate language class with a 96% accuracy on datasets the algorithms had not yet seen.

                                An accuracy of 75% was recorded from the best performing algorithm.

                                on in order to maintain and improve the standard of living by investing in electricity infrastructure. However, in recent years, there has been evidence that the use of purely non-renewable sources is not sustainable. The
                                government of Spain is considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. As such, they require information on the trends and patterns of the country's renewable sources and fossil fuel
                                energy generation. For this very reason, the government of Spain has been tracking the different energy sources available within the country.
